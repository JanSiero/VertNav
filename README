Vertical Navigation with CSS Classes

Vertical Category Navigation with subcategories, fine css classes and backend configuration.

<p>With this extension you're able to design you own vertical category navigation with subcategories and product count display. Each element has a fine css'ing so you can address each element or group exactly including "first" and "last" element per group and "previos", "active" and "next" child. The module removes the top.navigation via XML-Update and places the vertical nav in "left" structural block. You can change this by modifying the vertnav.xml file. Product count display can de switched on in your AdminPanel under <strong>system -> configuration -> catalog</strong> as per StoreView attribute.  You should modify the vertnav.css-file in your skin folder to fit you needs. (Please note: do not change the base/default skin file! The delivered CSS file is for showcase purposes only!)</p>
